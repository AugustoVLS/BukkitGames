# The cornucopia is a place at the spawn where the players can find chests, crafting table etc.
# If you want to spawn a cornucopia, enable the CORNUCOPIA in the config.yml
# Here you can config what should be spawned in the chests, which are spawned at the cornucopia.
#
# Layout for a item line:
# - 'ITEM_ID:DURABILITY,MIN_AMOUNT,MAX_AMOUNT,MUST_SPAWN,ENCHANTMENT_ID,ENCHANTMENT_LEVEL'
#
# Example for one a line:
# Bread, which will be spawned:
# - '297,2,5,true'
# Sword (with knockback enchantment), which maybe will be spawned:
# - '268,1,1,false,19,1'

# Do you want to spawn items at the cornucopia? (CORNUCOPIA has to be enabled)
ITEM_SPAWN: true

# Whether to spawn the items in chests or not
